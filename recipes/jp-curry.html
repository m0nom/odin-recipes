    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the butter over high heat until lightly smoking. Reduce heat to medium-high. Add the chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the onions are softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add the curry powder and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and cook, stirring, until no pockets of dry flour remain, about 30 seconds. Add the broth or water and stir to dissolve the flour. Add the potatoes, carrots, honey, and raisins. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to maintain a bare simmer. Cover and cook until the potatoes and carrots are tender but not falling apart, about 10 minutes.</li>
