    <h2>Scotch eggs</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>We need a few more ingredients (one from a previous <a href="./boiled-egg.html">recipe</a> ;3)</p>

    <ul>
        <li>500 gr Ground beef</li>
        <li>4 boiled eggs</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Panko</li>
        <li>Any neutral oil</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix the ground beef with your fav spices, or whatever you have laying around (I usually use minced garlic, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, rosemary and salt)</li>
        <li>Knead the beef until it becomes dough-like</li>
        <li>Put a piece of plastic on the table</li>
        <li>Add a sheet of ground beef </li>
        <li>Lightly roll the egg in flour and put in the middle of the beef</li>
        <li>
            Carefully cover the egg in the meat using the plastic
            <ul><li>You can do the motions like a candy wrapper</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Start heating up your oil, it should be around 160-180 degrees celsius.</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating up, grab one of your meat covered eggs, pass them thru eggs and then panko</li>
        <li>
            Fry until golden brown, or an internal temp of 65-70 degrees celsius
            <li>You can also skip the oil to make this healthier and just put them in a baking pan and put them in the oven at 350F/180C, until golden brown</li>
        </li>
    </ol>
